    "## Experiment design\n",
    "\n",
    "To discover the difference among the five algorithms and find the best one based on the statistic result, I choose to train the new model several times and using the same training data with a different random seed. And I collect the test score from each run and use autorank to detect the difference among the five groups of test scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Autorank will perform a test to reject the null hypothesis that it is no difference among those scores. If the result shows a difference between the five algorithms' values, I can choose the best algorithm by comparing the mean accuracy. The algorithm I choose for task 2 is Gradient boosting. And the design remains the same because to get each score. I use a different random seed to train a new model using the same training set so that this design can compare all the five algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reason for the design\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameter for the ensemble algorithms is the number of trees which is 10. The independent variables are algorithm types and datasets, and the dependent variable is the test score of each algorithm. There are ten runs of each model, and each run will create a new model with a different random seed. Then autorank will guarantee it uses an appropriate test and if it rejects the null hypothesis, we can use mean to decide which is the best algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output of the experiment    \n",
    "### Arrhythmia dataset\n",
    "For the Arrhythmia dataset, the means and standard deviations are below. The algorithm I choose is gradient boosting.   \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Gradient boosting is 0.789286 and the SD is 0.018655. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Bagging is 0.765476 and the SD is 0.023843.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Random Forest is 0.742857 and the SD is 0.040546.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Decision Tree is 0.683333 and the SD is  0.019602. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Adaboost is 0.690956 and the SD is 0.027844. </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the result, autorank performs the ANOVA test, and we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean of each group. So the best algorithm is Gradient boosting, but it is my choice for task2. Therefore, the best of task 1 is Bagging. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caesarian dataset\n",
    "I then perform the same design on the caesarian dataset and find out the best algorithm is Bagging from test one. Because there is one group of scores that is not normal, we have to perform Friedman test to determine the difference between median value of the population. The result is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The median of Adaboost is 0.516667 and the median absolute deviation is 0.0. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The median of Random Forest is 0.500000 and the median absolute deviation is 0.092662.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The median of Gradient Boosting is 0.500000 and the median absolute deviation is 0.0.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The median of Bagging is 0.437500 and the median absolute deviation is 0.092662. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The median of Decision Tree is 0.437500 and the median absolute deviation is 0.0. </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we reject the null hypothesis that it is no difference between the five populations. So we can assume there is a significant statistical difference. And the best algorithm here is Adaboost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### website-phishing dataset\n",
    "In this dataset, there are more than two two populations are normal but heteroscedastic, so we perform  non-parametric Friedman test. Here are the result: \n",

    "    <li>The mean of Bagging is 0.971732 and the SD is 1.876326e-03. </li>\n",

    "    <li>The mean of Adaboost is 0.932093 and the SD is 3.524132e-03. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of GradientBoosting is 0.913161 and the SD is 1.139065e-16. </li>\n",
    "</ol>   \n",
    "We reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the central tendency of the populations. But there is no significant difference within the group: Bagging, Random Forest. So the best algorithms are Bagging and Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breast cancer dataset\n",
    "This is for task 3. Finally the algorthm that does work best on any of the 3 datasets is decision tree algorthm. So I choose a dataset of breast cancer https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer where the dicision tree works the best. So here are the resuls:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Decision Tree is 0.962732 and the SD is 1.139065e-16. </li>\n",
    "    <li>The mean of Adaboost is 0.431034 and the SD is 5.695324e-17.</li>\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five populations and are normal but heteroscedastic. So the autorank use the Friedman test and reject the null hypothesis. But based on the Nemenyi test, there is no significant difference within the group's Decision Tree and Adaboost. So the best algorithms are Decision \n",
    "tree and Adaboost.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## How the dataset affects the performance of algorithms.    \n",
    "First, in the arrhythmia dataset, the algorithm that works best is bagging. This dataset has most of its data which is labeled class one. But the other class has a minimal amount of data, which makes the bagging classifier great because bagging reduces the variance of the results, over-fitting. A simple decision tree will not run well because it can not get enough train on the minority data and can not balance bias and variance. Random forest can be good at unbalanced data, and it is the second best, after Bagging.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the Caesarian dataset, the best classifier is Adaboosting. There are several possible reasons. First of all, this dataset is tiny, with only 80 samples, which is inappropriate for random forest and bagging, requiring a large amount of data. Secondly, we can see that each class's feature is not entirely prominent from the boxplot, and Adaboost is sensitive to slight differences.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the website-phishing dataset, the Bagging and Random Forest runs best because the number of features is significant, and there are also sufficient samples on both classes. As a result, it is not very suitable for a simple decision tree. Adaboost is more suitable for features that are not easy to distinguish.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Finally, the dataset that I found best for a simple decision tree has a tiny number of features, nine and two classes. So if we choose a good depth of the tree, it is better than others because others may be overfitting on the training data. And the data has many outliers, which is terrible for Adaboost.\n",
    "## Algorithm performs well on most datasets\n",
    "The algorithm that works best is Random Forest. It performs best in 2 out of 3 datasets, second-best on the other one. It is excellent on data with lots of features. It can handle a large number of input variables. For unbalanced classification data sets, it can balance errors. For datasets with a small number of samples, Random Forest also has good performance because it can assess the importance of features while determining categories.\n",
